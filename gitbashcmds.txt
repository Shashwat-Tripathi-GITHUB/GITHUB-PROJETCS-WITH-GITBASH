HELLO EVERYONE IN THIS FILE I AM GOING TO SHARE DAILY WHAT I HAVE LEARNED THROUGH GITBASH AND GITHUB. IT COULD EITHER BE COMMANDS TO USE OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF DAILY LEARNING SUCH AS ANY TIP 
TO USE GITBASH OR GITHUB WHICH MAKES THE PROCESS EASIER OR MORE INTERACTIVE AND INTERESTING.Let's start from the beginning. Create a file using mkdir(make a directory) and 
then initialise git in it using(git init)[which means git initialise].After initialising the git in the folder using gitbash apply different commands to accomplish tasks.
First let's see in what directory of our desktop we are working. To do this we will use the <pwd>[present working directory].
